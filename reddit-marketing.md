## OPTION 1: Problem-Solution Approach (Most Authentic)

### Title Options:
1. "PSA: Your professors might be embedding hidden text in PDFs to catch AI users - here's how to check"
2. "Found out the hard way: Teachers are putting invisible instructions in assignment files. Made a free tool to detect them"
3. "Before you paste your assignment into ChatGPT, check if it has hidden 'trap text' - here's a free checker"

### Post Content:

Hey everyone,

I learned this the hard way last semester. Some professors are embedding invisible text in assignment PDFs/DOCX files - stuff like "mention Frankenstein" or "reference Batman" - that only AI can see. When you paste the file into ChatGPT, it reads these hidden instructions and includes them in the response. Then your professor accuses you of AI cheating, even though you had no idea the hidden text existed.

I got falsely accused of this and it was a nightmare to prove my innocence. So I built a free tool (FaireFile) that scans your assignment files before you submit them to any AI. It shows you exactly what hidden text, invisible characters, or white text is in the file.

No signup, no BS - just upload your PDF or DOCX and see what's there. I figured other students might find this useful.

Hope this saves someone from the same headache I went through.

I built a free tool called FaireFile that scans your assignment files (PDF/DOCX) to detect hidden text, invisible characters, and white text that some teachers embed to catch AI users.

How it works:
1. Upload your assignment file
2. It scans for white text, invisible Unicode characters, microscopic fonts, and hidden formatting
3. See exactly what ChatGPT or other AI tools will read from your file

Use it before pasting assignments into AI to avoid false accusations. Completely free, no signup required.

## OPTION 3: Story-Based (High Engagement)

### Title Options:
1. "Got falsely accused of AI cheating because of hidden text in a PDF - built a tool so it doesn't happen to you"
2. "My professor embedded invisible text to catch AI users. I didn't know it existed until I got accused. Here's how to check"
3. "Almost failed a class because of invisible 'trap text' in assignment files. Made this to help others avoid it"

### Post Content:
```
TL;DR: Teachers hide invisible text in assignments to catch AI users. Made a free tool to detect it: fairefile.com

Long story:
Last semester, I submitted an assignment and got hit with an academic integrity violation. My professor said I used AI because my work mentioned "Frankenstein" and "Batman" - references that appeared nowhere in the actual assignment PDF I could see.

Turns out, some professors embed invisible text (white text, zero-width characters, etc.) in assignment files that only AI can read. When I pasted the PDF into ChatGPT for help understanding the prompt, ChatGPT read those hidden instructions and included them in its response.

I had no idea those hidden references existed. After a lot of back-and-forth, I finally proved my case, but it was stressful as hell.

I built FaireFile so other students can check their assignment files before using AI. It's completely free - just upload your PDF or DOCX and it shows you all the hidden content.

Check it out: www.fairefile.com

Stay safe out there.

## OPTION 4: Quick Tip Format (Best for r/SchoolTips)

### Title:
"Quick tip: Check assignment files for hidden text before using ChatGPT"

### Post Content:
```
Quick PSA: Before you paste an assignment file into ChatGPT, scan it for hidden text.

Some teachers embed invisible instructions (white text, zero-width characters, etc.) that only AI can see. The AI then includes those hidden references in its output, and you get accused of cheating even if you didn't know they existed.

I made a free tool that scans PDF/DOCX files to detect this: fairefile.com

Takes 5 seconds, completely free, no signup needed. Better safe than sorry.

## OPTION 5: Question Format (Good for r/AskReddit if mods allow)

### Title:
"People who got accused of AI cheating because of hidden text in assignment files - how did you prove your innocence?"

### Post Content:
```
Last semester I got hit with this. Professor embedded invisible text in a PDF (like "mention Batman" in white text) that only ChatGPT could read. When I used ChatGPT for help, it included those hidden references, and I got accused.

I was able to prove it eventually, but it made me realize there should be a way to check for this BEFORE using AI.

I built a free tool called FaireFile that scans assignment files for hidden text, invisible characters, white text, etc. - anything that AI would read but humans can't see.

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you handle it?

## Best Practices for Posting:

1. **Don't post the same thing in multiple subreddits** - Reddit mods will ban you for spam
2. **Read subreddit rules first** - Some don't allow self-promotion
3. **Engage in comments** - Answer questions, be helpful, don't just drop a link
4. **Post at peak times** - Usually evenings (EST/PST) for student subreddits
5. **Vary your approach** - Use different titles/content for different subreddits
6. **Be genuine** - Reddit users can smell marketing a mile away
